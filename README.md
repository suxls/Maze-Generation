- Uses Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm to generate a random solvable maze
  - supports constructing mazes with a bias in a particular direction through preference in weight between edges
    
- Suport Rendering color base on a cell's distance from the starting point / ending point
  
- Supports Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse through the maze
  - Error count displays the number of times the player / computer move towards a cell not in the shortest solution path 
  
- Supports manual playing across the maze
  - arrow keys for player movement
  - allows user to toggle display previously visited path
